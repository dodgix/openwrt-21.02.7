Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the documentation for the Go programming language.
